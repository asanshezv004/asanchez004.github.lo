<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Arturo Sanchez, I am 14 years old and currently I'm in my freshman year in Stem Academy of Boyel Heights. I am ejoying this school so far. Before I got here I attended in Belvedere middle school. I satyed there in my first year which is 7th garde and culminated from there in 8th grade. In elementary I attened in Evergreen Elementery. I skipped pre school and went to kinder. I liked the school because most of the teachers know me well because some of my teachers my brothers and sister had them while they were there. Then I culminated from there in my last year which is 6th grade.</p>
<h2>Hobbies</h2>
<p>For my hobbies I enjoy playing videogames in my free time. The type of games I mostly like playing are arcade fighting games like Marvel vs Capcom or any other types of fighting games. I also sometimes watch tv or help my mom clean in the house when she needs the help. I don't have any out door hoobies though. When I am playing games I mostly play alone but,hardly any one plays with me in the family because I play alot until I get really good at it that my family just sometimes gave up. Thats all my hobbies I do, I really don't do much at home or anywhere else.</p>
<h2>When I grow up</h2>
<p>When I grow up I was planning to become a chemist. I chose this because I really like science and I think it looks intersting. Also most of the work is hands on so that way you have more expierince when working with things related to science or chemistry. I have no interest in anything else in the future for now so now I am focused in chemistry so that way I could be a chemist.</p>
